{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:rddqte} computes the quantile treatment effects of a binary treatment variable using 
the regression discontinuity design. The estimators have been described in Froelich and Melly (2010).


{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Model}

{phang}
{opt quantiles(numlist)} specifies the quantiles at which the effects are 
estimated and should contain numbers between 0 and 1. 
Note that the computational time needed to estimate an additional quantile is very short compared to the 
time needed to estimate the preliminary nonparametric regressions. Note also that, when conditional QTE 
are estimated, only one quantile may be specified. If one is interested in several QTE, one 
can save the estimated weights for later use by using the option {opt generate_w}.

{phang}
{opt kernel(kernel)} specifies the kernel function. {it:kernel} may
be {opt epan2} (Epanechnikov kernel function; the default),
{opt biweight} (biweight kernel function),
{opt triweight} (triweight kernel function),
{opt cosine} (cosine trace),
{opt gaussian} (Gaussian kernel function),
{opt parzen} (Parzen kernel function),
{opt rectangle} (rectangle kernel function)
or {opt triangle} (triangle kernel function). 
By default, {opt epan2}, specifying the Epanechnikov kernel, is used. 

{phang}
{opt bandwidth(#)} sets the bandwidth used to smooth over the running variable. 
If the bandwidth is set to the missing value ".", an infinite bandwidth is used. 


{dlgtab:Inference}

{phang}{opt level(#)}; see 
{helpb estimation options##level():[R] estimation options}.

{title:Version requirements}

{p 4 4 2}This command requires Stata 9.2.

{net "describe moremata, from(http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/m/)":ssc describe moremata} and {net "describe kdens, from(http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/k/)":ssc describe kdens}{txt}.
