{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:cic} estimates the quantile treatment effects using the changes-in-changes framework of Athey and Imbens(2006). 
In the absence of covariates, the estimator suggested by Athey and Imbens (2006) is used. With covariates,
the estimator suggested by Melly and Santangelo (2015) is used. Only the case with two groups and two time periods 
has been implemented for the moment. The requested options {it: time} and {it:group} must provide 0/1 variables It is assumed
that only observations with {it: time}=1 and {it: group}=1 are treated.

{pstd}
Pointwise and simultaneous confidence sets for the effects are also constructed. 
The pointwise standard errors are obtained by the empirical bootstrap. The uniform confidence intervals are obtained
by inverting the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, whereas the bootstrap is used to estimate the distribution of
the test statistic. These are functional confidence intervals in the sense
that null-hypothesis that are outside of the uniform confidence interval at at least one of the estimated
quantiles are rejected at the pre-specified level.
The options {opt first(#)} and {opt last(#)} can be used to exclude the tails of the distribution from the 
functional inference procedure.

{pstd}
In addition to the uniform confidence bands reported in the main table, the p-values for some null-hypothesis
and two test-statistics are reported in a second table. Both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the Cramer-von-Misses-Smirnov
statistic are reported. The first set of null hypotheses is that there are no change at all. This is
stronger than the absence of any mean effect. Other null hypotheses of constant changes (but at a different level than 0)
can be added with the option {opt cons_test(#)}. The null hypthesis that all effects are equal to the median policy 
effect is also tested. Finally, both null-hypotheses of first-order stochastic dominance are tested.


{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Groups}

{phang}
{opth g:roup(varname)} is a 0/1 variable that selects the groups. 

{phang}
{opth t:ime(varname)} is a 0/1 variable that selects the time periods. 


{dlgtab:Quantiles}

{phang}
{opt q:uantiles(#)} specifies the quantiles at which the effects are estimated. By default, the 9 deciles treatment effects are estimated

{dlgtab:Conditional model}

{phang}
{opt nr:eg(#)} set the number of quantile regressions used to approximate the conditional distribution. 
The default is 100.{p_end}


{dlgtab:Inference}

{phang}
{opt noboot}suppress the bootstrap. The bootstrap can be very demanding in term of computation time. Therefore,
it is recommended to switch it off for the exploratory analysis of the data.

{phang}
{opt reps(#)}select the number of bootstrap replications. This number will matter only if the bootstrap has not
be suppressed. The default is 100.

{phang}{opt level(#)}; see 
{helpb estimation options##level():[R] estimation options}.

{phang}
{opt f:irst(#)} and {opt l:ast(#)} set the part of the distribution used for the inference procedures.
The tails of the distribution should not be used because standard asymptotic does not apply on these parts.
The parts that should be excluded depend on the sample size and on the distribution of the dependent variable.
{opt f:irst(#)} sets the lowest quantile used and {opt l:ast(#)} sets the highest quantile used.
The default values are 0.1 and 0.9.

{phang}
{help prefix_saving_option:{bf:saving}({it:filename}[, {it:suboptions}])}
creates a Stata data file ({opt .dta} file) containing bootstrap replicates.

{phang2}
{opt double} specifies that the results for each replication be stored as 
{opt double}s, meaning 8-byte reals.  By default, they are stored as
{opt float}s, meaning 4-byte reals. 

{phang2}
{opt every(#)} specifies that results be written to disk every {it:#}th
replication.  {opt every()} should be specified only in conjunction with 
{opt saving()} when it takes a long time for each replication.  This
option will allow recovery of partial results should some other software crash
your computer.  See {helpb post:[P] postfile}.

{phang2}
{opt replace} specifies that {it:filename} be overwritten, if it exists.

{phang}
{cmdab: cons:_test(}{it:#}[{it:#}[{it:# ...}]]{cmd:)}}add 
tests of the null hypothesis that effect(tau) = {it:#} for all taus between {it: first} and {it: last}.
The null hypothesis that effect(tau) = 0 for all taus between {it: first} and {it: last} is tested by default.
The other null hypothesis that the effects are constant is also tested by default.

{dlgtab:Reporting}

{phang}
{opt noprint} suppresses all tables of results. You may want to use it if you estimate a large number of QEs.
The results can always be found in the saved matrices.

{phang}
{opt noprinttest} suppresses the tables containing the tests but not the tables containing the estimates.
