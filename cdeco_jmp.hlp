{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:cdeco_jmp} decomposes the differences between the quantile function of {it:depvar}
when {it:group} is equal to 0 and the quantile function of {it:depvar}
when {it:group} is equal to 1. Two counterfactual distributions are
estimated by {cmd:cdeco_jmp}. First, the distribution based on the characteristics distribution for 
the group with {it:groupvar}==1,
the median or mean coefficients from the group with {it:groupvar}==1, and the residual distribution from
the group with {it:groupvar}==0 is estimated. Second, the distribution based on the characteristics distribution for 
the group with {it:groupvar}==1 and the conditional distribution of the {it:depvar} from the group with {it:groupvar}==0 is estimated.
These counterfactual distributions are used to decomposes differences in distribution 
into three components (residuals, median coefficients and characteristics).

{pstd}
This type of decomposition has been suggested by Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993, JMP thereafter). 
The original JMP decomposition is implemented if {opt method(loc)} is selected. 
In this case, the coefficients are estimated by a linear mean regression. The distribution of the residuals
is estimated independently of the {it:indepvars} by the unconditional distribution of the estimated residuals.
Therefore, the distribution of {it:depvar} is a function of the distribution of the {it:indepvars},
the OLS coefficients and the distribution of the residuals (assumed to be independent from the {it:indepvars}).
We obtain the decomposition by changing sequentially each of these elements.

{pstd}
Melly (2005) and Autor, Katz and Kearney (2005) suggest estimating the distribution of the
residuals by a family of quantile regressions. This avoids assuming that the residuals are independent
from the covariates. This decomposition is implemented if {opt method(qr)} is selected. 
In the first step, the distribution of {it:depvar} conditional on {it:indepvars} 
is estimated using linear quantile regression (see Koenker (2005) and {help qreg} 
for more information on quantile regression and its implementation in Stata). The conditional 
distribution is approximated by {opt nqreg} quantile regressions. 
Therefore, the distribution of {it:depvar} is a function of the distribution of the {it:indepvars},
the median regression coefficients, and the other quantile regression coefficients (that estimate
the conditional distribution of the the residuals).
We obtain the decomposition by changing sequentially each of these elements.

{pstd}
Two additional methods can be selected to estimate the conditional distribution of the dependent variable:
the location-scale shift model and the censored quantile regression model.

{pstd}
This estimator is a special case of the class of estimators covered by Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val
and Melly (2009). Therefore, its statistical properties as well as the validity of the bootstrap follow from
their results. The inference procedures are described in detail in Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val and Melly (2008).
Pointwise and simultaneous
confidence sets for the QEs are constructed, which
take into account the sampling variation in the estimation of the
relationship between the outcome and covariates. 
The pointwise standard errors are obtained by the empirical bootstrap. The uniform confidence intervals are obtained
by inverting the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, whereas the bootstrap is used to estimate the distribution of
the test statistic. These are functional confidence intervals in the sense
that null-hypothesis that are outside of the uniform confidence interval at at least one of the estimated
quantiles are rejected at the pre-specified level.
The options {opt first(#)} and {opt last(#)} can be used to exclude the tails of the distribution from the 
functional inference procedure.

{pstd}
In addition to the uniform confidence bands reported in the main table, the p-values for some null-hypothesis
and two test-statistics are reported in a second table. Both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and the Cramer-von-Misses-Smirnov
statistic are reported. The first null-hypotheses are the correct parametric specification of the conditional model.
Note that only the implications of the conditional estimation on the unconditional distribution is used. This implies
that this test may have a low power.
The second set of null hypotheses is that there are no difference at all. This is
stronger than the absence of any mean effect. Other null hypotheses of constant QE (but at a different level than 0)
can be added with the option {opt cons_test(#)}. The null hypthesis that all QEs are equal to the median policy 
effect is also tested. Finally, both null-hypotheses of first-order stochastic dominance are tested.


{title:Options}

{dlgtab:Groups}

{phang}
{opth g:roup(varname)} is a binary variable that selects the two groups. 
The counterfactual distribution is estimated using the covariates with {it: group}=1 and the conditional model
in the {it: group}=0 sample.

{dlgtab:Quantiles}

{phang}
{opt quantiles(numlist)} specifies the quantiles at which the effects are 
estimated and should contain numbers between 0 and 1. 
Note that the computational time needed to estimate an additional quantile is very short compared to the 
time needed to estimate the preliminary conditional model. By default, the 9 deciles are estimated

{dlgtab:Conditional model}

{phang}
{opt m:ethod(string)}}select the model used to estimate the conditional distribution. The following methods have been implemented: 

{phang2}
{opt m:ethod(qr)}, which is also the default, select the linear quantile regression estimator of Koenker and Bassett (1978).
{opt nreg} quantile regressions are estimated. The estimated conditional quantile function is monotonized using the 
re-arrangement method suggested by Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val and Galichon (2007). This allows to invert the quantile
function to obtain the conditional distribution function. This method should be used only with continuous dependent 
variables.

{phang2}
{opt m:ethod(loc)} select the linear location shift model. The conditional mean is estimated using OLS.
The residuals are assumed to be independent from the regressors such that the conditional distribution can be estimated
by the location shift plus the unconditional distribution of the residuals.

{phang2}
{opt m:ethod(locsca)} select the linear location-scale model. The logarithm of the variance of the residuals is
assumed to be a linear function of the variables given in {opth scale(varlist)}.
The conditional mean is estimated using OLS. The conditional variance is estimated by a second linear regression, 
that of the logged squared estimated residuals on {it: scale}. Finally, the distribution of the re-scaled residuals is 
estimated by the unconditional distribution of the re-scaled estimated residuals.
If the option {opt scale} is not specified, {cmd: cdeco} assumes that {it: scale} and {it:indepvars} 
are identical.

{phang2}
{opt m:ethod(cqr)} select the linear censored quantile regression estimator proposed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2002).
The censoring variable must be given in {opth c:ensoring(varname)}. By default, this estimator is a three-steps 
estimator. The number of steps can be increased by the option {opt ns:teps(#)}. In the first step, the censoring
probabilities are estimated by a parametric logit regression of {it: censoring} on {it: indepvars}. Then, for each
quantile regression, the observations with sufficiently low censoring probabilities relative to the quantile
of interest are selected. We allow for misspecification of the logit by excluding the observations that could 
theoretically be used but have censoring probabilities in the highest {it: firstc} quantiles. In the second step,
standard linear quantile regressions are estimated on the samples defined in step one. Using the estimated quantile
regression, we define a new sample of observations that can be used. This sample consists of all observations
for which the estimated conditional quantile is above the censoring point. Again, we throw away observations in 
the lowest {it: secondc} quantiles of the distribution of the residuals. Step three consists in a new linear quantile
regression using the sample defined in step two. Step three is repeated if {opt ns:teps(#)} is above 3.
The conditional distribution function is obtained using the same procedure as for quantile regression.

{phang}
{opt nr:eg(#)} set the number of regressions used to approximate the conditional distribution. 
{it: nreg} conditional quantiles uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 are estimated.
The default is 100.{p_end}

{dlgtab:Further options for the location scale model}

{phang}
{opth sc:ale(varlist)} select the scale variables. In the first step, {it: depvar} is regressed on {it: indepvars}.
In the second step, the squared residuals are regressed on {it: scale}. By default, {it: scale} contains the
same variables as {it: indepvars}.

{dlgtab:Further options for the censored regression model}

{phang}
{opth c:ensoring(varname)} is a variable containing the censoring value for each observation. This allows
for different censoring values for each observations. If the censoring value is the same for all observations, a
constant variable must be generated. Note that the implemented estimator assumes that we know the censoring
value for all observations, even those not censored.

{phang}
{opt ri:ght}indicate that the dependent variable is right-censored. By default, left-censoring is
assumed.

{phang}
{opt ns:teps(#)}select the number of steps performed. The default and minimum number of steps is 3.

{phang}
{opt f:irstc(#)}select the percentage of observations thrown out during the second step. Increasing this number 
will make the estimator more robust against misspecification of the censoring probability but less efficient.
The default is 0.1.

{phang}
{opt s:econdc(#)}select the percentage of observations thrown out during the third and following steps. 
Increasing this number 
will make the estimator more robust against misspecification of the censoring probability but less efficient.
The default is 0.05.

{dlgtab:Inference}

{phang}
{opt noboot}suppress the bootstrap. The bootstrap can be very demanding in term of computation time. Therefore,
it is recommended to switch it off for the exploratory analysis of the data.

{phang}
{opt reps(#)}select the number of bootstrap replications. This number will matter only if the bootstrap has not
be suppressed. The default is 100.

{phang}{opt level(#)}; see 
{helpb estimation options##level():[R] estimation options}.

{phang}
{opt f:irst(#)} and {opt l:ast(#)} set the part of the distribution used for the inference procedures.
The tails of the distribution should not be used because standard asymptotic does not apply on these parts.
The parts that should be excluded depend on the sample size and on the distribution of the dependent variable.
{opt f:irst(#)} sets the lowest quantile used and {opt l:ast(#)} sets the highest quantile used.
The default values are 0.1 and 0.9.

{phang}
{help prefix_saving_option:{bf:saving}({it:filename}[, {it:suboptions}])}
creates a Stata data file ({opt .dta} file) containing bootstrap replicates.

{phang2}
{opt double} specifies that the results for each replication be stored as 
{opt double}s, meaning 8-byte reals.  By default, they are stored as
{opt float}s, meaning 4-byte reals. 

{phang2}
{opt every(#)} specifies that results be written to disk every {it:#}th
replication.  {opt every()} should be specified only in conjunction with 
{opt saving()} when it takes a long time for each replication.  This
option will allow recovery of partial results should some other software crash
your computer.  See {helpb post:[P] postfile}.

{phang2}
{opt replace} specifies that {it:filename} be overwritten, if it exists.

{phang}
{cmdab: cons:_test(}{it:#}[{it:#}[{it:# ...}]]{cmd:)}}add 
tests of the null hypothesis that QE(tau) = {it:#} for all taus between {it: first} and {it: last}.
The null hypothesis that QE(tau) = 0 for all taus between {it: first} and {it: last} is tested by default.
The other null hypothesis that the QEs are constant is also tested by default.

{dlgtab:Reporting}

{phang}
{opt noprint}suppresses all tables of results. You may want to use it if you estimate a large number of QEs.
The results can always be found in the saved matrices. This option is similar to activating {opt noprintdeco}
and {opt noprinttest}.

{phang}
{opt noprintdeco}suppresses the tables containing the decomposition but not the tables containing the tests. 

{phang}
{opt noprinttest}suppresses the tables containing the tests but not the tables containing the decomposition.
